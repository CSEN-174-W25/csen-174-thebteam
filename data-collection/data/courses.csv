CAS, Anthropology,Emphasis Programs in Anthropology,,Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects competence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair.
CAS, Anthropology,1, Introduction to Biological Anthropology,"Using an evolutionary framework, we examine how past and current human variation is measured, our place in nature, human genetics, human and nonhuman primate biology and behavior, the primate and hominin fossil record, and the origin and meaning of human biological and behavioral variation. Students gain experience in biological anthropology methods, data analysis and interpretation, and the theoretical frameworks that guide our understanding of what it means to be human. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units)"
CAS, Anthropology,2, Introduction to Archaeology,"How do archaeologists understand the past? This course examines the methods, theories, and analytical techniques that archaeologists use to study the past and interpret ancient cultures. Selective survey of human cultures over time in different regions of the world. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units)"
CAS, Anthropology,3, Introduction Cultural Anthropology,"This course provides an introduction to the subject matter, research methods, and applications of cultural anthropology. Its purpose is to help students understand how different human groups think and live, how they cope with life’s demands and expectations, and how they make sense of the world. In order to gain additional experience with diverse cultural groups, students are required to participate in off-campus Arrupe partnerships. (4 units)"
CAS, Anthropology,4, Vanished Peoples and Lost Civilizations,"“Popular archaeology” is addressed by examining past societies, human migrations and cultural contacts, and ancient human behavior and technologies. Ideas and assumptions found in movies and other popular media will be evaluated in light of current archaeological data and theory. (4 units)"
CAS, Anthropology,5, Popular Culture and Bioanthropology,"From King Kong to Clan of the Cave Bear, students examine popular culture interpretations of biological anthropology.

(4 units)"
CAS, Anthropology,6," Screen Time: Culture, Film, and Media in the 21st Century","This course uses anthropological perspectives and methods to explore how popular media shapes, creates, and transforms our understanding of culture, identity, and social relationships in the 21st century. This course is not just about culture, difference, and identity, but also about how we learn about and intersect with cultural and identity formation processes through various forms of media. Throughout the course we will use feature-length films as starting points for thinking critically about culture, gender, class, race/racism, economics, ideology, family, kinship, and violence. We will also be critically discussing how film and media shape our perceptions and understandings of the complex, global, and highly socially mediated world in which we live. One of the core premises of this course, following Bird and Godwin (2006), is that we cannot simply assume that media “speaks for itself.” Building upon the work of cultural and media anthropologists, and the late Neil Postman, the primary goal of this course is to push students to take a more active, and anthropologically informed, approach to the highly mediated world in which we live. (4 units)"

CAS, Art  and  Art  History,123, The Global Renaissance,"The “Renaissance” has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural development associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges “high art”—that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture—over other forms of visual culture. This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles.

CAS, Ethnic Studies,178, Race and World War II,"World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war.

But calls for abolition are as much about envisioning new worlds as they are about ending various oppressive and unjust institutions. “Abolition,” as Ruth Wilson Gilmore puts it, “is about presence, not absence.” In this course, we will survey different visions of abolition, paying particular attention to clarifying and evaluating the moral arguments made by abolitionists. What does it mean, exactly, to call for the abolition of an institution rather than for reforms? What are the justifications for and critiques of these radical re-imaginings of our socio-political structures? We will also investigate the intersection of abolitionist issues with race, nationality, class, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, among other dimensions of identity. Finally, we will examine ethical theories of abolition democracy and transformative justice: two notions that abolitionists employ when thinking through how to build life-affirming institutions and community-based accountability processes in place of carceral systems.

This course develops the sociological analysis of gender systems in contemporary American society. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender structures the social world in which we live, and the way that race and sexuality interact with gender. We will highlight social practices at multiple levels of analysis, including biological and socialization processes at the individual level. Next, we will explore how gender shapes the interactions between and among women and men, creating and recreating gender. We will then use this multilevel framework to examine the workings of gender in the American workplace and as individuals balance work and family obligations. Finally, we will conclude by considering the possibilities of a degendered or less-gendered society. The central goal throughout the course is to understand how gender roles and attitudes shape social structure, and how gender inequalities are maintained in everyday social situations.

Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, health, criminal justice, the law, policing, housing and employment, the seminar considers the critical role of anti-Black racism and white supremacy in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level.

CAS, History,43, The Haitian Revolution in World History ,"Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the “age of democratic revolutions.” This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island.

CAS, History,143, The Haitian Revolution in World History,"Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the “age of democratic revolutions.” This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries.

What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia?

CAS, Public  Health  Department,187," Structural Racism: Race, Power and Resistance in the United States","This upper division seminar addresses systems of structural racism in the United States. Systemic and structural racism are defined as “forms of racism that are pervasively and deeply embedded in systems, laws, written or unwritten policies, and entrenched practices and beliefs that produce, condone, and perpetuate widespread unfair treatment and oppression of people of color, with adverse health consequences” (Braveman et al., 2022). Patterns of structural racism work alongside gendered systems of heteronormativity to reinforce white supremacy and the inequitable distribution of social and economic resources. Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, criminal justice, the law, policing and surveillance, health, housing and employment, the seminar will additionally consider the critical role of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, and the construct of the ‘ally’ in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level. The course integrates cross-disciplinary readings and visual and narrative media material from the growing body of work by scholar activists and racial justice movement leaders, as we consider whose meanings and voices are productive of the knowledge and action necessary to dismantle systems of white supremacy and sustain long-standing movements for racial justice.

CAS, Religious Studies,19, Religions of the Book,"This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense “binds” or “fastens together,” is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths. (4 units)"
CAS, Religious Studies,26, Gender in Early Christianity,"The history of early Christianity is often portrayed as a history of, by, and about men, despite clear indications that women played a prominent role in the early church.

We’ll use these primary “texts” to reconstruct the most plausible context for Jesus’ work so that we can better understand the Gospel message, and learn the criteria for assessing whether he really said and did what the Gospels report. We’ll also try to appreciate what the Gospel authors were doing in translating Jesus for their communities, just as we are doing ourselves with the historical approach of the course. (4 units)"
CAS, Religious Studies,28, Women Sex & Power: Gender In in the Hebrew Bible,"This course explores stores, tropes, metaphors, poetry, and archaeology related to Hebrew Bible and Old Testament (HB/OT) women. Biblical studies methodologies and interdisciplinary lenses will be used to create access points with the material culture of the Ancient Near East (ANE), literary life and afterlives of biblical texts, as well as intersectional juxtapositions between ANE and contemporary lives of women.

CAS, Religious Studies,48, Racializing Jesus,"The course explores the various ancient and contemporary ethnic representations of Jesus in art, film, regalia, and scripture. Although portraits of Jesus as a white, blue-eyed prophet, messiah, or rabbi haunt the popular cultural imagination, these often reflect the social location and racial biases of Western scholars. But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to “radicalize” Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler’s Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus’ wife. (4 units)"
CAS, Religious Studies,111, Bible and Ecology,"The Christian tradition has long been known for its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness), and traditional interpretations of the Bible have perpetuated the idea that God made the universe for humans, leaving other creatures to struggle amid both evolutionary forces and devastating human actions. What does the Bible really “say” about creation? What is the ethical significance of Jewish and Christian perspectives on the natural world, given our planet’s threatened state? (5 units)"
CAS, Religious Studies,112, Martyrdom,"This course interrogates the role of sacred texts in legitimizing contemporary discourses on martyrdom or “Dying in God.” Crucial questions to explore include: What is martyrdom and its relationship to ancient notions of noble death? Why are notions of martyrdom so prevalent amongst Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalist groups today? How is the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran used to legitimate violence against the self and others? Key themes to explore include: notions of a noble death in antiquity, imperial violence (crucifixion), the book of Revelation, martyrdom in early Christianity, the Crusades, Jonestown, Branch Davidians, secularization, fundamentalism (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), suicide bombing, school shootings, and the rise of the Islamic State. (5 units)"
CAS, Religious Studies,124, The Bible and Migration,"This course explores the current migration crisis at the U.S/Mexico borderlands and concomitant motivations, tensions, dilemmas, and perils of the migration journey. As the current migrant caravans at the U.S./Mexico border show, the planet is experiencing massive displacement of persons as a result of climate change, economic hardships, political unrest, wars, cartel violence, and neocolonialism. In their quest for human survival and freedom, migrants face religious intolerance, racism, exploitation and exclusion. Drawing from various scriptural, theological, ethical, sociological and anthropological approaches, this course equips students with a constructive pastoral response to the migrant crisis at home and abroad and challenges them to put a human face to the migrant other. Engaging a lecture-seminar format, the course will include films, guest speakers, and a visit to migrant communities, and deportations centers, and the U.S./Mexico border.

CAS, Religious Studies,132, Apocalypse Now,"This course provides a comparative introduction to ideas/symbols/theologies of the “End of the World” in three major monotheistic religions. In view of the influence of apocalyptic thought upon contemporary American culture in particular, and Western and non-Western societies in general, this course prepares students to responsibly engage in discussions of “End of the World” scenarios and their religious, socioeconomic, political implications. Themes germane to the course include: colonialism, environmental disasters (e.g., Pentecostalism), and alternative religious violence (e.g., Jonestown). In order to help students explore and articulate these themes, the course will provide various interpretive approaches from the theories and methods in the study of religion. We conclude the course by reflecting on the influence of apocalyptic thought upon our own spirituality, hopes, and religious traditions. (5 units)"
CAS, Religious Studies,148, From Babylon To Birmingham,"This course examines the role of prophets and prophecy in diagnosing social, theological, and political problems and instigating calls for justice and social change. Beginning with texts from the Hebrew Bible and Mesopotamia, this course will introduce students to the variety of ways humans have sought to decipher the will of the gods (through dream interpretation, omens, extispicy, and visions) as well as to complex rules which governed prophetic and interpretive activity. We will focus on figures like Moses, Isaiah, Amos, and Habakkuk to develop our paradigm of prophecy. In the second half of the course, we will examine modern day American prophets like Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Abraham Joshua Heschel, looking for points of continuity and discontinuity from the framework developed from our readings of biblical texts. (5 units)"

CAS, Religious Studies,NEW 180, Conflict and Common Good Ethics,"The idea that society's members share a ""common good,"" and that it is the responsibility of politics--and, indeed, all members of society--to promote it, is central to many religious and ethical traditions. It is especially central, perhaps, to the Catholic tradition, in which the common good features as a core principle of social ethics. But what does the ideal of the common good mean in highly pluralistic, fragmented, and, increasingly, conflictual societies, such as the contemporary United States? Can a society even be said to have a common good if its members radically disagree on what that common good is? And how is it possible, in practice, to promote the common good in the midst of difference, polarization, and conflict?
